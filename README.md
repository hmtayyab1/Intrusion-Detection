# Intrusion-Detection
The rapid digital transformation of industries and services has dramatically increased the need for robust cybersecurity measures. As the backbone of cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) protect networks by identifying and mitigating potential cyber threats. However, traditional IDS techniques, such as signature-based and anomaly-based methods, have shown limitations in handling evolving attack patterns, class imbalance, and temporal dependencies.
This project introduces a novel hybrid IDS that combines Random Forest (RF) and CNN-LSTM with Attention Mechanism to  address these challenges. By leveraging robust preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and deep learning, the proposed system achieves improved accuracy, reduced false-positive rates, and computational efficiency.
